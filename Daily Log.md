# Daily Log

All significant changes made to the software for 5249S will be documented here

## Initial Setup
### April 17, 2018
- Created repository for storing the code 
- Added reference files from last year's competition for driving control
- Made a c++ document with driving code from last year
## C-MVEXO [0.0.0]
### April 30, 2018
- Created the main file for the robot
- Put in a general PID calculator
### May 1, 2018
- Added last year's driving system
- Added driving for an H-drive chassis
### May 5, 2018
- Added driving for an X-drive chassis
- X-Drive Probably will not be used as only 8 V5 motors are allowed
### May 7, 2018
- Researched the new V5 Vision Sensor and researched ways to locate target using sensor for ball launcher
### May 9, 2018
- Finished initial ball launcher calculations
### May 20, 2018
- Began research on drag and looking to calculate projectile path incorperating drag
- Drag will probably not be used as it will most likely prove to be too precise
### May 30, 2018
- Finalized calculations for ball launcher including vision sensor distance calculations and projectile path with and without drag
### May 31, 2018
- Added code for a ball launcher that calculates if it will hit a target
- Commented different parts of the code
- Put ball launcher code in a seperate file, it will be added in future versions
### June 3, 2018
- Found calculations for auto angle adjustment
### June 6, 2018
- Changed the PID calculator format so it can be easier used with the object oriented part of c++
### August 14, 2018
- Overlooked newly released API for Vex Coding Studio
### August 18, 2018
- Integrated VEX OS into the main program
- Version 0.0.0 is ready to be tested
